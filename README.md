# Token Incentives for Language Preservation

Welcome to a decentralized platform that combats language extinction by incentivizing users to preserve endangered languages through learning, content creation, and community verification! Built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts, this project rewards participants with native tokens for contributing to language preservation apps, helping revive and maintain cultural heritage in a globalized world.

## ✨ Features

🌐 Register and track endangered languages  
📚 Submit and verify language content (words, phrases, lessons)  
💰 Earn tokens for contributions, learning milestones, and verifications  
🏆 NFT badges for top preservers  
🗳️ Community governance for language additions and reward adjustments  
🔒 Secure staking for long-term commitment to preservation efforts  
📊 Analytics dashboard for language health metrics  
🚫 Anti-spam mechanisms to ensure quality contributions  

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Language Learners**  
- Connect your wallet and select an endangered language from the registry.  
- Use integrated apps to complete lessons or quizzes.  
- Call the reward-distribution contract to claim tokens upon milestones (e.g., learning 100 words).  
- Stake tokens for bonus rewards on continued learning.  

**For Content Creators**  
- Generate a hash of your language resource (e.g., audio recording of native phrases).  
- Submit via the content-submission contract with details like language ID and description.  
- Community verifies through the verification contract—earn tokens if approved!  
- Mint NFTs for high-impact contributions.  

**For Verifiers and Community Members**  
- Use the verification contract to vote on pending submissions.  
- Participate in governance proposals to add new languages or tweak rewards.  
- Stake tokens to influence decisions and earn yields.  

**For App Developers**  
- Integrate with the platform's contracts to build preservation apps.  
- Users earn tokens seamlessly through your app's interactions with the reward system.  

That's it! Join the movement to save languages—one token at a time. Deploy on Stacks testnet to get started!
